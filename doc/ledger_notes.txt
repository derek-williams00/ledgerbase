ledgers are run on individual machines.


A ledger is a construct, a ritual performed by zero or more parties.



The identity of a ledger, that which seperates one ledger from another, is called its basis.



The basis of a ledger has two parts, the original charter and initial conditions.

The charter can change just like the rest of the the state that a ledger has.





The ledger has a history which is organized into chapters.

Each chapter covers a span of time.
